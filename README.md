# Monikk87-model_movie_rentals_durations_Datacamp

### Predict how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on several features

### Data 
The data was provided in Datacamp and was added to this repositor.


### Motivation
Via this project I wanted to practice my understanding of random forest regression models
  

### Thought process
- I did exploratory analysis
- I converted the rental and return dates columns to datetime and made manipulations to create rental length
- I examined rental length distribution to derive implications for the regression model
- I created dummy columns from the special freatures column
- I prepared the dataframe for the regression model
- I tested two hyper parameters
- Based on the results I calculated the lowest MSE
